1. Whispering Pines
Silent forest hums,
Pine needles dance with the breeze,
Nature's lullaby.

2. Morning Dew
Dew clings to soft grass,
The sun rises, gently warm,
Nightâ€™s tears fade away.

3. Autumn Leaves
Crimson leaves flutter,
A gust takes them far from home,
Whispers of goodbye.

4. The Lonely Moon
Moon high in the sky,
Watches over sleeping towns,
In her quiet glow.

5. Silent Snowfall
Snow falls without sound,
Blanketing the world in white,
Peace in every flake.
